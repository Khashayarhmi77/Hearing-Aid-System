# Hearing-Aid-System
In this project, I implemented a single channel of a multi-channel compressor of a hearing aid system in MATLAB Simulink. A fundamental characteristic of a compressor is to apply gain to the input signal in a compressive manner. This means that it should apply more gain to weak signals and as the signal strength grows, the amount of applied gain should decrease to avoid unnecessary loudness. To achieve this goal, the designed compressor works in three regions: linear, compressor, and limiter. In the linear region, a constant gain is applied. In the compressor region, the applied gain decreases as the input level increases. In the limiter region, the output level is kept at a certain level. These three regions are implemented using three blocks and put in series to form the overall system. Several simulation results have been provided to validate the performance of the single-channel compressor. Please read the project report for a complete explanation of the method and the simulation results.
